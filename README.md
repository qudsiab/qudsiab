## About Me

I'm an aspiring CS student just trying to find my way in the world of tech. I love learning new things, messing around with ideas, and figuring out how things work behind the scenes. I’m not an expert yet, but I’m curious, determined, and excited to grow. Every project, every mistake, and every little win is part of the journey, and I’m enjoying the process as I keep improving and discovering what I really want to build in the future.
